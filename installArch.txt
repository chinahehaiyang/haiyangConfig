- assume its UEFI

*************************************
do the following before chroot in
*************************************
- first need to format the partitions, so should format the root folder as "ext4", and the /efi as "vfat"
- mount the file systems: 
mount /dev/sdX1 (root directory) /mnt
mount /dev/sdY1 (efi stuff) /mnt/efi (create /mnt/efi first)

- use pacman to install the base stuff:
pacstrap /mnt base base-devel	(base -devel is optional.. whatever)
- generate fstab

*************************************
 chroot in
*************************************

- for time, should first get sudo (or else it does not show all timezones idk why...) 
- for list timezones just do 
sudo timedatectl list-timezones
- then just set it  
sudo timedatectl set-timezone Canada/Mountain
- then symlink it to the /etc/localtime
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Canada/Mountain /etc/localtime

- then edit /etc/locale.gen to get the language you need, which would be 
en_US.UTF-8
and other chinese locales
- then create /etc/locale.conf, and add "LANG=en_US.UTF-8"

-for creating a user:
useradd -m  -G wheel,otherGroups -s /bin/bash kevin (groups can be found on arch wiki)

- go to visudo and uncomment:
%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL


-initramfs
mkinitcpio -p linux
- if have these warnings (but its just warnings and the firmware is in AUR, can actually safely ignore..):
Possibly missing firmware for module: aic94xx
 Possibly missing firmware for module: wd719x
 - just do:

git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/aic94xx-firmware.git
cd aic94xx-firmware
makepkg -sri

git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/wd719x-firmware.git
cd wd719x-firmware
makepkg -sri

-pacman.conf: add this line for archlinuxcn
Server = https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/archlinuxcn/$arch

-should get grub for bootloader, and create /boot/efi and mount it there
- firstly mount the /boot/efi ..
- then do the commands on the wiki, and then grub-install
- since we need to duoboot, need to install os-prober and ntfs-3g and (maybe dislocker) then mount the windows bootloader, then remake grubconfig.. 
- to create the grub.cfg use
 grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

-exit chroot
- umount -R /mnt and reboot
