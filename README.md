To fix chromium border, go to `Settings` -> `Use system title bar and borders`

To "enable" pdf scrolling with vimium, get PDF Viewer from chromium store.

Also add dash to /bin/sh i guess?

# Emoji coverage
install the following font packages from pacman (I don't recall which package actually fixes the problem but just install these there is no harm):
```
noto-fonts-emoji
```
Maybe add the rest, but you don't really need it..
```
ttf-font-awesome
ttf-inconsolata
ttf-symbola
unicode-emoji
```
