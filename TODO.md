# My TODO list for future improvements

- [ ] maybe add a better notification daemon (than`libnotify`), like [dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst)
- [ ] automate the process of detecting a HDMI cable, and what to do with it. This way I won't need to create predefined shell scripts with `xrandr` that only works for a specific machine. This might make me move to xmonad, although I'm still not sure how to dynamically increase or decrease the workspaces in xmonad ...
